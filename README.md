# Stay-at-home-orders-by-state-for-COVID-19

The files, Stay-at-home orders by state in USA for SARS-CoV-2.pdf, and Stay-at-home orders by state in USA for SARS-CoV-2.xlsx, contain the start dates of stay-at-home orders by state for the USA. Because the information was gathered quickly during the early days of the pandemic, a few dates are incorrect (mostly by 1-2 days).	

The files, Stay-at-home orders and relaxation by state in USA for SARS-CoV-2.pdf, and Stay-at-home orders and relaxation by state in USA for SARS-CoV-2.xlsx, contain the correct dates along with expanded information regarding the relaxation of the stay-at-home orders and closures.
